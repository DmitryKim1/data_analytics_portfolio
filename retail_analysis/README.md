# Retail Analysis


## Introduction

**[Notebook results](https://github.com/gituse412/data_analytics_portfolio/blob/main/retail_analysis/RetailAnalysis.ipynb)**

**[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset)**

In this project, I took a dataset from kaggle and went all the way through analyzing this table. I got rid of the outliers, conducted a research analysis of the data, visualized the results and made conclusions and suggestions for improving the product, in our case it is a store.


This dataset is a snapshot of a fictional retail landscape, capturing essential attributes that drive retail operations and customer interactions. It includes key details such as Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount. These attributes enable a multifaceted exploration of sales trends, demographic influences, and purchasing behaviors.

## Final report
Conclusion: on average, men and women spend the same. The average age of buyers among men and women is the same . the most unsold product is cosmetics. We can say that there is a relationship between the month and the number of purchases (February 14), depending on the holiday, our customers can buy more or less goods. Purchases by category do not differ from each other in any way.
